# errors-and-solutions-when-installing-R-packages

Keep track of the errors and solutions when I install R packages.

In particular, for those errors that I couldn't find a ready-to-use solution online. See below for a summary.

1. takes me 20 min to install 'caret'. Below is a key command. See the related file for detail.
install_github("lme4",user="lme4")

2. To install 'randomForest', I could not install from sources.
